I'm building something called **Vox Mosaic**—a curated essay publication that brings together twenty writers exploring themes of transformation, becoming, and the moments that break us open.

This isn't another blog or newsletter. Each edition is designed as a cohesive, beautifully crafted collection—more like a limited-run art book than a content feed. Think: high-end design, thoughtful curation, and essays that deserve to be read slowly.

Your writing on [relevant theme they write about] aligns with what we're exploring in Edition One. I think your voice would add something essential.

**What's in it for you:**

- **Cross-promotion**: Your essay reaches the combined audiences of all twenty contributors
- **Premium presentation**: Your work showcased in a designed publication, not just a webpage
- **Featured profile**: Permanent author page on voxmosaic.com with bio and links
- **Edition release event**: We launch each edition as an event, driving concentrated attention
- **Editorial support**: Optional feedback and light editing before publication

**The ask:**

One personal essay (1,500–3,000 words) on the theme of transformation—broadly interpreted. Could be identity, loss, reinvention, migration, or anything that fits the spirit.

**Timeline:**

Edition One targets [Month 2026]. We'd need your essay by [deadline].

If this sounds interesting, I'd love to tell you more. Would you be open to a quick call, or would you prefer I send over more details?

Either way—thank you for your work. It matters.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. You can see the landing page at voxmosaic.com, though it's still early days.

## Key Personalization Points

When customizing these templates, always include:

1. **Specific piece of their work** you've read (with genuine reaction)
2. **Why their voice specifically** fits the collection
3. **How their themes align** with transformation/becoming
4. **Their platform/audience** that makes cross-promotion valuable

## Do Not

- Mass send without personalization
- Fake familiarity you don't have
- Over-promise on audience size or reach (we're new)
- Pressure or follow up more than twice
