# Vox Mosaic — Author FAQ

## About Vox Mosaic

### What is Vox Mosaic?
Vox Mosaic is a curated essay publication featuring twenty writers per edition, exploring themes of transformation, becoming, and pivotal life moments. We release quarterly editions as designed digital collections—think of it as a literary magazine meets art book, delivered digitally.

### How is this different from a blog or newsletter?
Three key differences:
1. **Edition-based releases**: We don't publish on a rolling basis. Each edition launches as an event, concentrating attention and promotion.
2. **Design-forward**: Every edition is professionally designed as a cohesive visual experience, not just text on a webpage.
3. **Curated community**: Each edition features a deliberate mix of voices that speak to each other thematically.

### Who reads Vox Mosaic?
Our readers come primarily from our contributors' combined audiences. As we grow, we're building an independent readership of people who value thoughtful personal essays and beautiful design.

## The Contribution

### What kind of essays are you looking for?
Personal essays on transformation—broadly interpreted. This could include:
- Identity shifts and self-discovery
- Immigration and displacement
- Loss, grief, and what comes after
- Career reinvention or leaving something behind
- Family dynamics and generational stories
- Recovery and rebuilding
- Coming out or coming into yourself

We're looking for honest, reflective writing that explores a moment (or moments) of becoming.

### What's the word count?
1,500–3,000 words. We're flexible within this range—the essay should be as long as it needs to be.

### Can I submit something previously published?
We prefer original, unpublished work for Edition One. If you have something previously published that you feel is a strong fit, let's discuss—it depends on where and when it appeared.

### Do I retain rights to my work?
Yes. You grant us non-exclusive rights to publish your essay in Vox Mosaic. You can republish elsewhere after our edition launches (we ask for a 30-day exclusivity window post-launch).

## Compensation & Benefits

### Is there payment?
For Edition One, we're not offering upfront payment as we're launching and building audience. What we offer instead:

- **Cross-promotion**: Your essay reaches all twenty contributors' audiences
- **Featured author profile**: Permanent page on voxmosaic.com with your bio, photo, and links
- **Premium presentation**: Your work in a designed publication, not just a blog post
- **Community**: Connection with other writers in the collection

As we grow and monetize (through premium editions, print versions, or sponsorship), we plan to share revenue with contributors.

### What promotion do you provide?
For each edition launch:
- Email announcement to our full subscriber list
- Social media campaign featuring each contributor
- Individual author spotlights leading up to launch
- Coordinated launch day with all contributors

We also provide shareable assets (graphics, pull quotes) for contributors to use.

### Can I promote my own newsletter/book/project?
Absolutely. Your author bio and profile page can link to anything you'd like—your newsletter, book, website, social media, etc. We want this to drive value back to you.
