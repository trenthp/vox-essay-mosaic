2. **Launch Week** (Edition goes live)
3. **Post-Launch** (Ongoing promotion)

## Cross-Promotion Strategy

### The 20-Voice Advantage

Each contributor has their own audience. When all 20 promote:
- Minimum 20x reach vs. solo publication
- Warm introductions (author recommending author)
- Network effects compound with each share

### Facilitated Connections

**Before launch:**
- Introduce contributors via email/Slack (optional)
- Share preview access so authors can read each other's work
- Encourage organic connections

**During launch:**
- Provide "recommended reads" list for each author
- Suggest 2-3 specific cross-promotion pairings based on themes
- Create a shared hashtag: #VoxMosaicEditionOne

**After launch:**
- Facilitate "author conversations" (optional Twitter Spaces, IG Lives)
- Encourage contributors to stay connected

### Cross-Promotion Guidelines

**Do:**
- Tag the author when sharing their work
- Be genuine—only recommend what you actually loved
- Engage with comments on your cross-promo posts

**Don't:**
- Feel obligated to promote all 19 others
- Share without reading (authenticity matters)
- Spam—quality over quantity

---

## Asset Distribution

### Option A: Notion Hub (Recommended)

Create a private Notion page for each author with:
- Their personalized assets (quote cards, profile cards)
- General edition assets
- Copy templates (customizable)
- Direct links to their profile and essay
- Timeline and posting schedule
- FAQ and support contact

**Pros:** Easy to update, professional, one link to share
**Cons:** Requires Notion setup

### Option B: Google Drive Folder

Create a shared folder structure:
```
/Vox Mosaic Contributors
  /Edition One
    /General Assets
      - Edition cover graphics
      - Logo files
      - Brand guidelines
    /[Author Name]
      - Quote card (IG).png
      - Quote card (Twitter).png
      - Profile card (IG).png
      - Profile card (Twitter).png
      - Copy templates.txt
```

**Pros:** Familiar to most, easy downloads
**Cons:** Less polished, harder to update copy

### Option C: Website Contributors Page

Host everything on voxmosaic.com/contributors:
- Password-protected or unlisted
- Downloadable assets
- Copy templates on page
- Links to profiles

**Pros:** On-brand, no external tools
**Cons:** Less personalized, manual updates
