# Vox Mosaic Submission Guidelines

## Edition One Theme: Transformation

We're looking for personal essays that explore the moments that break us open and remake us whole—transformation in all its forms.

---

## What We're Looking For

### Theme Interpretation

"Transformation" is intentionally broad. Your essay might explore:

- **Identity**: Coming into yourself, leaving behind who you were
- **Migration**: Physical or metaphorical—new places, new selves
- **Loss & Recovery**: What grief dismantles; what you rebuilt
- **Reinvention**: Career pivots, life changes, starting over
- **Family**: Generational patterns broken or continued
- **Becoming**: The slow (or sudden) process of change

The best essays find the universal in the specific. Show us your particular moment, and let it resonate outward.

### Voice & Approach

We value:
- **Honesty over polish**: Raw truth beats literary performance
- **Specificity**: Concrete details ground abstract ideas
- **Reflection**: Not just what happened, but what it means
- **Risk**: Essays that go somewhere uncomfortable or surprising

We're less interested in:
- Advice or prescriptive content ("here's how to transform your life")
- Essays that resolve too neatly
- Surface-level treatment of deep subjects
- Writing that prioritizes cleverness over connection

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I submit more than one essay?**
For Edition One, please submit your strongest single piece. We may reach out about additional work for future editions.

**Can I submit something I've posted on my blog/newsletter?**
We prefer unpublished work. If you have something previously shared (especially to a small audience), mention it in your submission and we'll discuss.

**What if my essay doesn't fit the theme perfectly?**
Transformation is broad. If your essay explores change, growth, loss, or becoming in any form, we want to see it. When in doubt, submit.

**Will you give feedback if I'm not selected?**
We unfortunately can't provide detailed feedback to all submissions, but we'll let you know our decision and are happy to point you toward resources.

**Can I submit again if not selected for Edition One?**
Absolutely. Future editions will have their own themes, but we encourage resubmission.
