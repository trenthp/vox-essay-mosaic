## Contingency Plans

### If we don't hit 5 contributors by Week 10:
- Extend outreach by 2 weeks
- Consider launching with fewer essays (minimum 3)
- Push launch date if needed

### If essays are late:
- Built-in buffer: 1 week between deadline and editorial start
- Can accept late submissions up to Week 17
- After Week 17, defer to Edition Two

### If design takes longer:
- Prioritize web version (can launch without PDF)
- PDF can follow 1-2 weeks post-launch
