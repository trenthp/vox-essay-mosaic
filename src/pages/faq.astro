          <h3 class="faq-question">What is Wingmarks?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Wingmarks is a curated essay collection by Luminous Estate about the encounters
              that rearranged us: the people, animals, and living systems that left lasting
              impressions. Each edition brings together twenty voices exploring the marks left
              by contact, designed to be read together.

          <h3 class="faq-question">Is it free to read?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes. Edition One will be freely available on the web and as a downloadable PDF.
              We believe great writing should be accessible.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How often do you publish?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We release one edition per quarter, each exploring a different kind of encounter.
              This pace allows us to be thoughtful about curation and give each contributor
              meaningful attention during launch.

          <h3 class="faq-question">Do you pay contributors?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes. For Edition One, we're splitting proceeds 50/50 &mdash; half to the authors
              and half to building the next edition. The more books the group sells, the more
              everyone earns. Contributors also receive a featured author profile,
              cross-promotion from the Wingmarks community, and premium presentation of
              their work.

          <h3 class="faq-question">What rights do you require?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We ask for 30 days of exclusivity from the publication date. After that, you're
              free to republish your essay anywhere. You retain all rights to your work.
