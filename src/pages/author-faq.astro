          <h3 class="faq-question">What kind of essays are you looking for?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Essays about the people, animals, or living systems that rearranged you. Encounters
              that changed how you orient toward the world. A stranger whose brief presence altered
              your internal compass. A relationship that pulled you into a new orbit. These stories
              don't need to be dramatic; we're especially interested in subtle, psychologically rich
              moments that facilitated lasting change. But if you've got a compelling dramatic story,
              we want those too.

          <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need to be a professional writer?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No. We care about the quality of your essay, not your credentials. We've seen
              extraordinary work from first-time writers and established authors alike. If
              you have a story worth telling and tell it well, we want to read it.

          <h3 class="faq-question">Can I submit something I've published on my blog or newsletter?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We're looking for previously unpublished work only. This includes personal blogs,
              Substack, Medium, and similar platforms. However, if you have an older piece that
              was published years ago and has since been taken down, reach out to discuss.

          <h3 class="faq-question">What rights do you require?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We ask for first publication rights and a 30-day exclusivity window from the
              launch date. After those 30 days, you're completely free to republish your
              essay anywhere: your newsletter, a book collection, another publication.
              The work remains entirely yours.

          <h3 class="faq-question">Do you pay contributors?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              For Edition One, we're unable to offer monetary payment. We're a new publication
              building from scratch. What we offer instead: a premium author profile with links
              to your work, cross-promotion from nineteen fellow contributors, and beautiful
              presentation of your essay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to introduce revenue sharing with contributors as we grow. We're
              committed to building a sustainable model that values writers fairly.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What happens after I submit?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              You'll receive a confirmation email within 24 hours. Our editorial team reads
              every submission carefully. This takes time, so please be patient. We aim to
              send all decisions within 6-8 weeks of the submission deadline.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Will my essay be edited?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, but collaboratively. If your essay is selected, we'll work with you on
              light developmental and copy editing. We'll never publish changes without your
              approval. The final essay is always your voice, refined.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What if my essay isn't selected?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We'll let you know via email. Unfortunately, we can't provide detailed feedback
              on every submission due to volume. A rejection doesn't mean your essay isn't
              good. It often means it wasn't right for this particular edition's focus or mix
              of voices. We encourage you to submit again for future editions.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What will my author profile include?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Your profile page will feature your headshot, bio, links to your website and
              social media, an excerpt from your essay, and eventually the full essay itself.
              It's designed to introduce readers to you and drive them to your other work.

          <h3 class="faq-question">How will you promote my essay?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Each contributor receives dedicated promotion during our launch campaign. This
              includes social media features, newsletter spotlights, and coordinated promotion
              across all twenty contributors. The power of Wingmarks is collective attention:
              twenty audiences coming together around twenty stories.
