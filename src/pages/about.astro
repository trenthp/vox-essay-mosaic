        <h2 class="section-title">Why Wingmarks exists</h2>
        <p class="lead-text">
          There is no permanent self. As humans, we're constantly shaped and reshaped
          by contact, with new patterns forming over even our most entrenched grooves
          when we brush up against what's other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wingmarks is a collection of personal essays about the encounters that rearranged
          us: the people, animals, and living systems that left lasting impressions. The name
          is the thesis: we carry the marks of everything that has touched us.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a moth lands on glass, it leaves a faint dusting of wing scales, a trace of
          contact so delicate you might miss it. But the mark is real. The encounter happened.
          Something was exchanged. That's what these essays explore: the moments of contact
          that left something behind.

        <div class="feature-grid">
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3 class="feature-title">Curated, not collected</h3>
            <p>
              Twenty voices per edition, chosen to speak to each other. Not a loud
              mosaic, a shared hush. Distinct marks creating one surface.

          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3 class="feature-title">Designed like a book</h3>
            <p>
              Each edition is a crafted experience, not content in a feed, but
              essays presented with the care of a physical publication.

          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3 class="feature-title">Creator-led publishing</h3>
            <p>
              Not traditional publishing. Not self-publishing. A curated collective where
              social media voices become literary voices, with a prestige house behind them.

        <h2 class="section-title">The vision</h2>
        <p>
          Edition One is just the beginning. Wingmarks will release quarterly, each edition
          exploring the marks left by a different kind of contact, through twenty distinct voices.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we grow, we plan to offer print editions, premium collections, and eventually
          share revenue with contributors. We're building a publication for people who notice
          subtlety, who sit with complexity, who describe inner experience with precision.
