        <h2 class="section-title">Why Vox Mosaic exists</h2>
        <p class="lead-text">
          We wanted to create the publication we were looking for as both a reader and a writer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no shortage of places to publish personal essays online. But we kept searching
          for something different: a publication that treated essays as art, not content. One that
          brought together voices intentionally, creating conversation between pieces rather than
          just stacking them in a feed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wanted essays presented beautifully, in editions that felt like events. We wanted to
          read twenty perspectives on a single theme and feel like we understood something new about
          being human by the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          We couldn't find it. So we're building it.

          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3 class="feature-title">Edition-based releases</h3>
            <p>
              No endless scroll. Each edition launches as an event, with concentrated attention
              and promotion for every contributor.
            </p>

          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3 class="feature-title">Design-forward presentation</h3>
            <p>
              Every edition is a designed experience. Your essay isn't just text on a
              webpage—it's part of something crafted.
            </p>

          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3 class="feature-title">Curated community</h3>
            <p>
              Twenty voices per edition, chosen to speak to each other thematically.
              The whole becomes greater than the parts.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title">Writers retain rights</h3>
            <p>
              Your work stays yours. We ask for 30 days of exclusivity, then you're
              free to republish anywhere.

        <h2 class="section-title">The vision</h2>
        <p>
          Edition One is just the beginning. Vox Mosaic will release quarterly, each edition
          exploring a different theme through twenty distinct voices.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we grow, we plan to offer print editions, premium collections, and eventually
          share revenue with contributors. We're building this in public, learning as we go,
          and committed to doing right by the writers who trust us with their work.
