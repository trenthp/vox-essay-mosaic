excerpt: "I left everything I knew at thirty-two. Not because I was brave, but because staying had become more terrifying than the unknown. The morning I boarded that plane, I carried two suitcases and a lifetime of questions I couldn't yet answer."
teaser: "In this deeply personal essay, Elena examines how the physical weight of what we carry becomes a metaphor for the emotional baggage of leaving home - and the surprising lightness that can come from starting over."
