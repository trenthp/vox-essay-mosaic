excerpt: "The old man never introduced himself. He just appeared at the edge of the orchard one October morning, pruning shears in hand, and began cutting back the deadwood as if he'd been doing it his whole life. Maybe he had. I watched from the kitchen window, coffee going cold, trying to decide whether to be afraid."
teaser: "A stranger shows up to tend an orchard you've inherited but don't understand. Over the course of a single autumn, his wordless presence teaches you more about stewardship, grief, and belonging than a lifetime of deliberate instruction."
