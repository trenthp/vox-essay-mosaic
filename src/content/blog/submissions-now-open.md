We're thrilled to announce that submissions are officially open for Wingmarks Edition One.

## What is Wingmarks?

Wingmarks is a curated essay collection about the encounters that rearranged us — the people, animals, and living systems that left lasting impressions. Each edition brings together twenty voices exploring the marks left by contact.

## What we're looking for

We want personal essays between 1,500 and 4,000 words about encounters that changed how you orient toward the world. A stranger whose brief presence altered your internal compass. A relationship that pulled you into a new orbit. An animal or living system that shifted your understanding.

These stories don't need to be dramatic. We're especially interested in subtle, psychologically rich moments that facilitated lasting change. But if you've got a compelling dramatic story, we want those too.

## What contributors receive

Every selected author receives:

- **50/50 revenue split** — half of all proceeds go to authors, half to building the next edition
- **A premium author profile** — a dedicated page showcasing your bio, photo, and links to your work
- **Cross-promotion** — coordinated promotion across all twenty contributors and our channels
- **Beautiful presentation** — your essay designed and presented as part of a curated collection
- **Rights retention** — you keep all rights; after 30 days exclusivity, republish anywhere
