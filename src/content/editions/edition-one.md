## The Theme

There is no permanent self. As humans, we're constantly shaped and reshaped by contact, with new patterns forming over even our most entrenched grooves when we brush up against what's other.

Edition One brings together twenty writers exploring the encounters that rearranged them — the people, animals, and living systems that left lasting impressions. A stranger whose brief presence altered an internal compass. A relationship that pulled someone into a new orbit. An unexpected journey into another way of being that left them unable to return to the familiar.

## The Contributors

Our twenty voices come from different backgrounds, geographies, and life stages. What unites them is their willingness to sit with the marks left by contact — not just the dramatic encounters, but the subtle, psychologically rich moments that facilitated lasting change.
