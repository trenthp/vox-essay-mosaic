            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Personal essays on transformation—broadly interpreted. This could include identity
                shifts, immigration and displacement, loss and what comes after, career reinvention,
                family dynamics, recovery and rebuilding, or coming into yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're looking for honest, reflective writing that explores a moment (or moments)
                of becoming.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                1,500–3,000 words. We're flexible within this range—the essay should be as long
                as it needs to be.

              <p>
                We prefer original, unpublished work for Edition One. If you have something
                previously published that you feel is a strong fit, let's discuss—it depends
                on where and when it appeared.

              <p>
                For Edition One, please submit your strongest single piece. We may reach out
                about additional work for future editions.

              <p>
                Yes. You grant us non-exclusive rights to publish your essay in Vox Mosaic.
                You can republish elsewhere after our edition launches (we ask for a 30-day
                exclusivity window post-launch).

                Submissions are open now. We send editorial feedback within 2 weeks of submission.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Yes, but it's collaborative, not prescriptive. We offer developmental feedback
                if requested, light copyediting for clarity and consistency, and a final proofread
                before publication.
              </p>
              <p>
                We won't change your voice or rewrite your essay. All edits are suggestions you
                can accept or decline.

                Life happens. If you need to withdraw before publication, let us know as soon
                as possible. We ask that you don't withdraw after the edition is designed and
                ready to launch (typically 2 weeks before).
