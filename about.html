          <h2 class="section-title">Why Vox Mosaic exists</h2>
          <p class="lead-text">
            We wanted to create the publication we were looking for as both a reader and a writer.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's no shortage of places to publish personal essays online. But we kept searching
            for something different: a publication that treated essays as art, not content. One that
            brought together voices intentionally, creating conversation between pieces rather than
            just stacking them in a feed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We wanted essays presented beautifully, in editions that felt like events. We wanted to
            read twenty perspectives on a single theme and feel like we understood something new about
            being human by the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            We couldn't find it. So we're building it.

              <h3 class="feature-title">Edition-based releases</h3>
              <p>
                No endless scroll. Each edition launches as an event, with concentrated attention
                and promotion for every contributor.
              </p>

              <h3 class="feature-title">Design-forward presentation</h3>
              <p>
                Every edition is a designed experience. Your essay isn't just text on a
                webpage—it's part of something crafted.

                Twenty voices per edition, chosen to speak to each other thematically.
                The whole becomes greater than the parts.

                free to republish anywhere.

          <h2 class="section-title">The vision</h2>
          <p>
            Edition One is just the beginning. Vox Mosaic will release quarterly, each edition
            exploring a different theme through twenty distinct voices.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we grow, we plan to offer print editions, premium collections, and eventually
            share revenue with contributors. We're building this in public, learning as we go,
            and committed to doing right by the writers who trust us with their work.
